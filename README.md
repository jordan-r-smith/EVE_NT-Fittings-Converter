# EVE_NT Fittings Converter
Simple python script to convert the EVE_NT fittings spreadsheet into an XML file that the EVE client and other fitting tools can easily and quickly read.

Spreadsheet needs to be in the same folder as the script when you run it. Spreadsheet and/or script will probably need to be modified everytime a new spreadsheet of fittings is released because of how finicky and weird the EFT fitting format is with the EVE client import tool.
